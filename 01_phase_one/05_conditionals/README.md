# Conditionals

Conditionals work the same way as other languages, but we need:

* Brackets () to enclose the condition.
* Curly braces {} to enclose the code "body" executed following this condition.

```javascript
const a = getSomeValue();

if (a === 10) {
  // do these things
} else if (a === 20) {
  // something else?
} else {
  // whatever
}
```
