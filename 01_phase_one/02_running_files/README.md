# Running Files

Notes:

* Watch out for missing semicolons - Prettier can help out with this:      
Either install the VSCode extension or in the terminal do ```npx prettier --write .``` or to check first do ```npx prettier --check .``` then write.
* To run a JS file in the terminal: ```node filename```.
